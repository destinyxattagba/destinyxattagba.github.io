                <p>Côte d'Ivoire <em>-- also known as Ivory Coast --</em> is a West African country situated in between <strong>Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, and Mali.</strong>
                It is one of the most prosperous West African countries due to various export products and foreign investments. The country's name comes from its involvement in the ivory trade along the coastline.
                Côte d'Ivoire boasts tropical weather that spans three seasons: warm and dry, hot and dry, and warm and wet. Its flag is orange, green, and white, the reverse of the Irish flag.
