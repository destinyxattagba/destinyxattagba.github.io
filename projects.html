                <p>This semester, I was lucky enough to take a class called Physical Computing, where I was able to use Python, Circuitpython, 
                    microboards, and other electrical components to prototype functional ideas, both practical and creative. For this project, I used Circuit
                    Python and an Adafruit Circuit Playground Express board to create a device that holds a beverage and uses a temperature probe to read the temperature
                    of the beverage. Additionally, the device flashes color depending on what the temperature is.

                <p>In my Physical Computing class, I had the creative freedom to execute an Idea that interested me for our final project.
                    I decided to create a replica of a record player that detected the color of "vinyls" (replicas) and played specific mp3 files, telling a story.
                    I told a short story of black hair and the black experience using pop culture clips, interviews, and news recordings.

                <p> This past summer, I interned at Accenture, a global consulting company, where I worked on a project concerned with
                    maintaining and improving the API of the client. In my free time, I decided to teach myself basic web development that could use
                    Spotify's API to give statistics about top songs. Currently, I'm adding a feature to generate playlists based on user input and host 
                    a guessing game.
