<h2> about me! </h2>
<p> My name is Destiny Attagba, and I'm a Computer Science and French double major
    at the University of Miami, minoring in Film and considering a second minor in 
    interactive media. I'm very goofy, extroverted, and a little creative, which is why 
    I'm interested in web design and wanted to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Some of the
    coding languages that I know include Python and Java, although I'm currently trying to learn
    C# with Unity development at the moment. Some of my other interests in the CS world also include
    Augmented Reality / Virtual Reality, creative software engineering, medical research and
    possibly game development.
