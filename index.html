<h1> greetings from destiny attagba!</h1>

<h2> about me! </h2>
<p> My name is destiny attagba, and I'm a Computer Science and French double major
    at the University of Miami, minoring in Film and considering a second minor in 
    interactive media. I'm very goofy, extroverted, and a little creative, which is why 
    I'm interested in web design and wanted to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Some of the
    coding languages that I know include Python and Java, although I'm currently trying to learn
    C# with Unity development at the moment. Some of my other interests in the CS world also include
    Augmented Reality / Virtual Reality, creative software engineering, medical research and
    possibly game development. 

    When I'm not coding, I'm usually enjoying music, writing / directing / storyboarding film or video,
    shopping, watching cartooons, or spending time and family. I'm a very HUGE movie lover, and 
    fun fact -- I host a radio show at WVUM. I'll try to keep an updated list of my current favorite
    songs on this website. I'll also include links to the projects I'm working on at some point.
</p>

<h2> top 10 songs at the moment </h2>
<p> The following songs are the top 10 songs that have been on repeat for me for the last week or so. They're listen here 
    in the format of song title - artist name(s). </p>

<p> Again, I'm really big on music and I'll continue to update this throughout the following weeks. Some of my favorite albums from this year that will
    probably appear on this list include A Bird's Eye View - Ravyn Lenae, Hit Me Hard and Soft - Billie Eilish, Hardstone Psycho - Don Toliver, 4 - Kenny Mason, 
    Tyla - Tyla, Megan - Megan Thee Stallion, and One of Wun - Gunna.
