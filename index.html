<h1> greetings from destiny attagba!</h1>

<h2> about me! </h2>
<p> My name is destiny attagba, and I'm a Computer Science and French double major
    at the University of Miami, minoring in Film and considering a second minor in 
    interactive media. I'm very goofy, extroverted, and a little creative, which is why 
    I'm interested in web design and wanted to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Some of the
    coding languages that I know include Python and Java, although I'm currently trying to learn
    C# with Unity development at the moment. Some of my other interests in the CS world also include
    Augmented Reality / Virtual Reality, creative software engineering, medical research and
    possibly game development. 

    When I'm not coding, I'm usually enjoying music, writing / directing / storyboarding film or video,
    shopping, watching cartooons, or spending time and family. I'm a very HUGE movie lover, and 
    fun fact -- I host a radio show at WVUM. I'll try to keep an updated list of my current favorite
    songs on this website. I'll also include links to the projects I'm working on
