            <p>This project is an animated music video / lyric video to <em>Plead the .45th</em> by Smino and Saba, for the soundtrack of the movie Judas
            and the Black Messiah. In Spring 2024, I took an introductury class in 2D animation where I learned the principles of animating, elements of storytelling
            and how to create simple animations using Adobe AfterEffects and Adobe Premiere. This video was produced for my final project in the class and combined my 
            interests of music and film directing, as well as teaching animation and helping me hone my editing skills.  </p>

             <p> This project / side hobby formed after I got involved with my school's radio station, WVUM. I found out that I could host my own radio show and 
                play sets that I could curate, with some minor restrictions. Thus, Oscillation was born. I describe Oscillation as a celebration of historically marginalized
                artists who've contributed insurmountable influence to modern day music, primarily through the genres of soul, r&b, and hip-hop. These genres and their respective
                subgenres are underlying themes in all modern popular music, so I use oscillation as a way to pay homage to these genres and play lesser known artists who contribute 
                to them. Want to listen? Check out my show on every other Monday from 7-8 <a href="https://www.wvum.org/listen">here</a>!</p>
